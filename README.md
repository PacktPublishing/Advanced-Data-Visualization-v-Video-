## About the Video Course
Basic visualizations are often all that we need for many instances, but there are also times when we need to expand our repertoire to build advanced visualizations. We begin with designing and implementing dashboards, a highly popular yet often poorly executed visualization type. Then we look at using temporal data to create dynamic visualizations that transport the user through time, adding significant context and detail to the visualization. Then we spend time building interactivity into visualizations, giving users the opportunity for additional exploration and analysis. The final section deals with deploying visualizations, either to alternate formats for further customization or to the web for browser-based interaction.
